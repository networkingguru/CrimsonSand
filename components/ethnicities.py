culture = 'The northern barbarians are separated into 6 tribes: The Hunters (Madrs), The Keepers (Gaetirs), The Wanderers (Floakras), The Masters of the Peak (Dróttinn-Gnípa), The Gatherers (Saman), and The River Dwellers (Elfi-Búi). Each tribe has its own leader and religious beliefs, as well as it’s own “specialty”. Each tribe has thrall over its own area of the Northern Wastes, with the exception of the Wanderers, who constantly roam the entire waste. The barbarian tribes feud fairly regularly, however, the Keepers keep watch over Broderni-Borg, which is a “safe haven” for all tribesmen. For this reason, the Keepers tend to stay out of feuds with other tribes. When in Broderni-Borg, all barbarians are required to remain peaceful to one another. Any violators are punished according to the laws of the Keepers and the whim of the keeper’s leader, Falki Pureheart. Regardless of tribe, all barbarians tend to follow a similar social structure. The Chieftain is the supreme leader over the entire tribe. The Chieftain is always male (as are all other important members of society), and his word is looked upon as final and unquestionable. To question the Chieftain is to challenge the Chieftain, which will (usually) insight a ceremonial battle. If the Chieftain does not insight a ceremonial battle, it may be taken as a sign of cowardice and concession, in which case the tribe may choose the challenger as the new Chieftain. The winner of a Ceremonial battle is either the last man standing, or the one who does not concede. Each tribe will also have a group of elders (equal to 25% of the tribe’s total population) that are given the responsibility of providing the Chieftain with advice. Any man who lives to 45 summers or older is automatically a member of this group. Priests may or may not form a segment of a given tribe. Barbarians are highly religious, but it is rare that one fills the call of the Gods strong enough to devote his life to the Gods. Such is not the normal way of the Barbarian. Barbarian Women are given the tasks of gathering herbs and spices and cooking meals from the meat hunting parties provide, raising Children, and maintaining the shelters. Children are inducted into whichever role they are to play at age 13. Males must undergo “the Trial”, which is a test of manhood designed to prove the male’s prowess in hunting, combat, and endurance. While the trial specifics vary, depending on the tribe in question, all are extremely difficult, and the successful child is one who has spent his entire life preparing for the trial. Any male who fails the trial is cast out from the tribe, and will forever be ignored by tribal members (thought they are still welcome in Broderni-Borg). \nUpon passing the trial, a male child is given an amount of money (generated from the tribe’s sale of furs and such at Broderni-Borg) to travel to Broderni-Borg and buy a suitable weapon. Most tribes do not have their own Smith, so this is the primary means of weapon acquisition.\nBarbarians tend to follow a strict but simple set of “rules”, handed down by Odin himself and commonly known as “Odin’s Laws”. These are as follows:\n1.	“Battle is the true test of worth” (All potential battles must be met forcefully, and cowardice is never permitted. Battles are viewed as the ultimate test of worth in the eyes of the Barbarian. For this reason, battle scars are looked upon as signs of worth, and each male Barbarian will likely keep track of all battles they have been involved in as well as the number of foes vanquished)\n2.	“Always remain true to your tribe” (All tribal requests must be honored to the death.)\n3.	“Respect those of more years than your own, as they have survived more colds of Winter and heats of Battle than have you.” (Always respect your elders)\n4.	“Always provide additional food for your family, so that your children may gorge themselves and become strong warriors.” (This limits the effects of a Barbarian’s polygamy. A Barbarian may never only provide “adequate” food for his family, he must also provide second and third helpings for his family. The basic rule is that every meal should be a feast. A barbarian who cannot follow this rule will most likely be forced out of the tribe, along with his family)\nViolation of any of these laws is punishable by the whim of the Chieftain, but common punishment is exile.'
history = 'Northern Barbarians were once sea-faring men, and great explorers. The barbarian lands once stretched from the Northern Wastes down to the Femefinta Mountains. While they have always had their roots in the North, it wasn’t until “The Great Divide” of 2021 that the barbarians were overcome by mistrust among the tribal chieftains and driven back by the Solomanians into the Northern wastes. For this reason, nearly all barbarians have a deep-seated hatred of all Solomanians. During the battle, the great Solomanian wizard Mordinkain set loose many unholy and unnatural creatures upon the barbarians. Upon Mordinkain’s death in the battle of Baedi-Elfi, these creatures, loose from their master, spread into the Northern Wastes and multiplied. For this reason, nearly all barbarians also have a deep-seated fear of magic of any kind. It has been speculated by seers and historians that Odin himself persuaded Loki to seed the mistrust among the Barbarians, in order to make the entire Barbarian race stronger in preparation of “The Change”. While the truth to this has yet to be revealed, Barbarian legend does proclaim that one day, a mighty Chieftain will be born that has the power to reunite the tribes and reclaim the lands that are the Barbarian’s rightful home. The barbarians were one of the few races to be mostly unaffected by the great cataclysm of 2476, as they have very little in the way of infrastructure.'
phys_desc = 'Barbarian males are typically very large and well-muscled. Obesity is seen as a sign of weakness, and therefore, barbarians are as a rule rarely obese. Since battle scars are seen as signs of prowess at battle, most males are covered with tens (and sometimes, hundreds) of battle scars. Barbarians rarely cut their hair, and specimens with hair reaching to or beyond their lower back is not uncommon. Barbarian females are typically larger than most human females as well, though not nearly as muscular as the males.'

culture = 'Corrillians have well defined and flexible feudal society. King Arian Lionheart rules the country, with a board of royal advisors to guide his actions. King Lionheart rules by his well-respected Father’s example, using force only when necessary, and generally maintaining a fair hand. Corrillia is divided into four territories, The City-State of Freeport, The Northern Plains, Willow Valley, and the Southern Stretch. A Lord oversees each of these areas from a territorial Capital, with a Baron overseeing each individual smaller city. Law in Corrillia is handled by each city ruler and his panel of advisors. Typically, court will proceed once per week, where the ruler will briefly hear the pleas of both the accused and the accuser, and decide on proper punishment. If necessary, the ruling can be appealed, first at the territory level, and finally to the King himself, though a third party must do so (the accused cannot appeal directly). There are no fees for the hearing process (though fines may be instated as punishment in some cases). All peasants in Corrillia are indebted to the local baron for their land, who is in turn indebted to the Lord of the territory, who is in turn indebted to the King. Taxes are collected at each city or village in each territory to pay for this debt. At the local level, typically 50%% of collected taxes go to the Lord, while 50%% remain with the Baron. The Lord then typically gives 25%% of these taxes to the King, and retains 75%%. Peasants in the area are taxed twelve times per year based on legal property. Each taxation period extracts 2%% of the total value of legal property (as assessed by the tax collector), for a total annual tax rate of 24%%. Peasants are allowed to do as they please (including travel to other nations), as long as their taxes are paid. If a peasant misses the taxation for a given period, a fine of 15%% is added to the taxed amount. If the peasant misses two or more periods, they are jailed until the next hearing date, where the Baron will determine appropriate punishment. Militarily, the Corrillian army stands around 40,000 strong, with approximately 60%% foot soldiers, 10%% archers, 20%% Cavalry, and 10%% Elite forces (mostly knights). In addition, approximately 100,000 troops can be conscripted from the ranks of unskilled peasants in times of extensive war. The Corrillian Navy is the true strength of the Corrillian military forces, numbering over 300 ships and with excellent captains and crew. Each Lord keeps a contingent of knights, used for quests of importance and in jousting tournaments with other Lords. To qualify as a knight of the land, a peasant must prove him or herself as a warrior through a trial including combat with one or more knights on horseback and on foot. If successful, the knight will be given a squire, an annual salary, and given the title of “Sir”. Upon proving his worth to the country, upon his retirement the Knight may be offered several positions by the Lord, from Baron to Captain of the Guard, depending on the Knight’s stature. Also, Knights that prove themselves to be extremely capable may be asked by the King to perform as Knights of the Crown. Only 24 Knights of the Crown are allowed, and to be requested is considered a great honor. For this, the Lord whom the knight serves is given a great gift from the King, from riches to newly conquered lands. Any immigrant may become a Citizen of Corrillia by applying at the local Baron’s Keep on specific days of the year. If accepted, the new citizen will be given land, and from there on will be expected to pay taxes as any other Corrillian Citizen. \nCorrillia’s primary income comes from the export of Lumber and finished goods. Corrillian craftsmen are particularly skilled with wood products, and due to the nation’s size, weaponry and armor are also major exports (though their quality is only average). \nMost peasants in Corrillia make their living off of one of five general trades, listed in order of popularity: Fishing, Logging, Farming, Skilled Craftsmen, and Mercantile. \nReligion in Corrillia is diverse and common, with most peasants worshiping the God Lugh, but with temples to other Gods of the Celtic pantheon in various areas. Only worship of the Celtic pantheon is allowed by citizens, but traveling citizens of other nations are allowed to do as they please. Temples to other pantheons, however, are not allowed in Corrillia. \nMagic is supported in Corrillia by the Order of the Stream, the Corrillian Mage’s guild. All Magicians who will be living within Corrillia are encouraged to join the guild. For more information, see the Magic section of this work. \nCorrillian diet consists of standard vegetables augmented with large amounts of fish and other marine animals (due to Corrillia’s thriving fishing industry). In royal circles, eastern spices from Wedei usually augment this fare. \nCorrillian architecture is in the medieval European flare, along with Corrillian music and art.'
history = 'Corrillia was founded in Year 1493 (The Year of the Blue War) by Tibur of the North, an Antarian (an ancient civilization overrun by Solomania in 1649) conscripted by the Styigian army. Tibur rose in the army to become the Supreme Commander. After a long and bloody war with Wedei, the Stygian leader, High Priest Tot’Amathet chose to offer every Stygian firstborn son to the Bitch-Queen Demon of the fifth hell as an offer to Set. Tibur rebelled, and fled the country with his family and a contingent of his most trusted and elite soldiers. Clearing the abandoned keep of Averspire, Tibur sent runners to Stygia’s border cities to warn of Tot’Amathet’s plans, and offer security in his outpost. Over 20,000 peasants fled Stygia before Tot’Amathet could recount his plans and stop the exodus. Stygia immediately went to war with Tibur’s renegade faction, however, the toll of the long war with Wedei, as well as the loss of several thousand soldiers, 20,000 peasants, and the experience of Tibur’s army, were too much for the Stygian army to overcome. Tibur named his City-State Corrillia, after a fabled nation of greatness, and formed a basic Feudal society. Over many generations, Corrillia’s open system of trade and citizenship caused the budding nation to prosper economically, while Averspire’s proximity to two major rivers and the ocean allowed Corrillians to become excellent seafarers and fishermen. In addition, the military training system Tibur initiated built the army of Corrillia into an organized, highly capable fighting force. In the years between 1580 and 1590, advances by the Corrillian army into the southern plains to the west of the Femefinta Mountains expanded Corrillia’s territory to the point where it could no longer be governed as a single City-State. In 1593, the City-State of Corrillia was renamed Freeport, and a new city-state called Farmer’s Glade was founded to the south. In the next 20 years, the war with Stygia would reach a standstill, and several smaller villages would grow into minor cities. The government of Corrillia was reshaped once again in 1632, breaking the nation into territories overseen by a Lord, and relegating each city to a Baron (creating the governmental form that Corrillia uses to this day). \nIn 1649, Solomania conquered Antara to expand the ancient nation as far as the Willow valley, making Solomania a neighbor of Corrillia. Corrillia and Solomania began a war that would last for 60 years in the summer of 1652. During this time, the Wedei formed an empire, conquering the ancient nation of Shem and forcing Stygia into the Morge peninsula. The Eastern Empire then began expanding upward, Taking the cities of Granitekeep (now Lauji’nine) and Alenon (destroyed in the cataclysm of 2476) from the Solomanians. In 1710, with no gains made by either side, peace was declared between Corrillia and Solomania. With the exception of the occasional raid from Hyperboria (the barbarian kingdom), Corrillia enjoyed a time of relative peace for the next 300 years (this is known as “The Golden Age”). The war with Stygia still commenced, but it amounted to little more than border cities changing hands every 10 years or so. During this time, much progress was made in research of magic and science, and Corrillia was the first nation to use gunpowder in battle. In 2010, disgusted with “unwashed hordes”, as he called the Hyperborians, and greedy for land and power, King Rentsi “the foolish” entered into an alliance with Solomania to conquer the Hyperborian lands. King Rentsi saw the Hyperborians as “push overs” compared to the more “civilized” nations, and expected a quick and decisive victory. Instead, for 5 years, Corrillians took heavy casualties, loosing over 50% of their fighting force during this time. What the Hyperboreans lacked in technology, they more than made up for in ferocity and sheer numbers. In 2015, the Corrillians ended their war with Hyperboria, and retreated to Freeport to lick their wounds. This angered the Solomanian Lich-King, but he chose to bide his time until making his anger known. In 2016, after their defeat at the hands of the Hyperboreans, the Corrillian military, led by Lord Whisndown, overthrew King Rentsi and had him publicly executed. The then-King Whisndown spent the next 20 years rebuilding the rag-tag Corrillian military into a cohesive fighting force, and instated Knights of the Crown to protect and guide the generals.\nIn 2021, aided by the separation of the tribes, Solomania crushed Hyperborea and laid claim to their lands, but not before a barbarian Horde raided the capital and destroyed the Lich-King. The remaining tribes were forced into the Northern Wilderness, where it was thought they would die out.  The new Solomanian King Orin waited 15 years until his army had rebuilt itself, and waged war on Corrillia, following the last wishes of the Lich-King. Unfortunately for King Orin, Corrillia, under the leadership of King Whisndown, had amassed an enviable fighting force with excellent training and proper logistical support. Not only did Solomania not succeed, the Corrillian counter-attack succeeded in gaining many of the lands Solomania had taken from the Hyperborean conquest. By the year 2200, Corrillia controlled nearly all of the upper reaches of the continent, with it’s western border reaching to Kebrina, Amazonia, and Solomania, and it’s southern border ending at the Femefinta Mountains. Rather than eliminate Solomania, however, King Whisndown VI (“The Merciful”) chose to end the advance on Solomania. While not putting an end to the war, it did allow Solomania to survive and begin rebuilding itself. The war with Stygia still raged, however, and Stygia was unwilling to agree to peace proposals. In 2476, a great cataclysm opened the earth in the Northern Wastes to form the Great Rift, and gave rise to the 300 mile long “Hinderlands” and it’s active Volcano. The resulting shockwaves, smoke, and dust, destroyed over 80% of the world’s population, bringing to ruin most of the smaller civilizations. Their surviving peoples were assimilated into various countries. Most of Corrillia’s cities were partially destroyed, and Freeport caught fire and burned to the ground. Mage towers and research facilities worldwide were brought to ruin, and much of the advances gained in the last 1000 years were forever lost to the rubble. Corrillia survived, however, and began rebuilding their once-proud nation. Corrillian King Olaf II (“The Sacrificer”), like monarchs of many other nations, would fund expeditions to the new island known as the Hinderlands. The expeditions that returned would tell of a barren wasteland, pocked with caves, and a huge volcano whose top billowed smoke, brimstone and ash thick enough to make the trip to the island a deadly game of chance.  Expeditions to the Hinderlands would cease after the pox of 3022 (believed to be brought to Freeport by an expedition to the Hinderlands), but during this time the Corrillians would also discover, and establish a trade partnership with, the Elvish Isle. The pox of 3022 decimated the population of Freeport, and threatened to spread to the rest of the world. While the Elves did find a cure in 3026, King Olaf II would order Freeport, and all of its inhabitants (including himself and his family), to be burned to the ground in 3023. This act placed Lord Jentil in position to take the Corrillian throne, and he would begin the process of rebuilding Freeport. Freeport was rebuilt again in 3046, and in the coronation ceremony, a grand statue standing over 50’ tall and made of the finest marble would stand as a testament to the sacrifices of all who died in the fire. In the next 700 years, Corrillia would battle to regain their lands of old, and carry on the never-ending wars with both Solomania and Stygia. In 3550, Corrillia embarked on the largest construction project in recent history, when they built the two-mile long bridge and keeps controlling the Inland causeway.  As of the year 3762, Corrillia is once again the largest nation in the realm, though it has yet to regain its former stature. Under the wise leadership of King Arian Lionheart, Corrillia waves it’s banner proudly and faces the future with hope.'

culture = 'Stygia is one of the oldest nations known to man. Most ancient records that survive only reach back into year 400 or 500, but Stygia was even mentioned in some of these. Stygian civilization is based on a Theocracy, with the High Priest of Set ruling (Currently High Priest Amotept II), and a council of Arch-Bishops ruling under him. Unlike many societies, women are allowed in the ranks of Stygian theocracy, though none have yet to reach the level of High Priest in recorded history. \nStygian rule is accomplished by a rigid power structure, whereby Priests populate Temples, Bishops hold sway over all priests and followers of a given temple, Arch-Bishops hold sway over a group of temples in a given area, and the High Priest holds sway over all. \nStygia doesn’t tax, per se. Rather, Stygian priests visit each household once per week and collect tithe for the Cult of Set. Tithe in Stygia is 40% of the week’s earnings. Stygian priests care little for excuses, and if tithe isn’t paid, a member of the family will be taken to use for slave labor. If there are no family members, the citizen in question will be taken. It the tithe is paid later, plus a fee determined by the Jailor, the enslaved family member may be returned. If not, the enslaved family member can expect one of two fates: Enslavement for forced labor (if the family member is a male in good health), Enslavement as a concubine or assistant (if the family member is an attractive, non-virgin female), or to be sacrificed at the next offering to Set (once per month; If the family member is a virgin female, this will definitely be the case. Otherwise, if there is no other use for the member, they will become an offering).\nStygian rule is based on fear, with little or no compassion. Laws are strictly enforced, and “eye-for-an-eye” punishments are common. A few common punishments for various laws are listed below:\nTheft: Removal of dominant hand\nProstitution: Sacrifice\nMurder: Sacrifice\nFreeing a slave or prisoner: Enslavement\nGambling: Removal of an eye\nUnfortunately, the Stygian legal system is also ruled by Priests, making it very prone to corruption. If you are caught committing a crime, you are immediately jailed. If you receive a hearing, you will most likely receive either the harshest punishment possible (if you are unknown and useless to the Priest), or be let free immediately (If you pay high tithes or can somehow help the Priest). It is also not uncommon for a prisoner to starve to death awaiting trial, if they are unknown. \nThe Stygian military is composed of both an army (Nëron Belgom, or “Holy Warriors”) and Navy (Zëi Sidhdhi, or “Sea Snakes”). The army consists of around 30,000 men, with the ability to call another 60,000 or so in times of great strife. The Stygian navy is around 100 warships strong. Stygian military training is above average, but not extremely disciplined. The Stygian military is ruled by a single “Supreme Commander” (Irränë Befel). Under the supreme commander are captains of the Army and Navy, and under them, captains for each individual division. Stygia also has a sect of elite warrior Priests known only as the “Morge’clidhu”. \nOne must be born of Stygian blood to be a Stygian citizen, and Stygian citizens are citizens for life. Any citizen who attempts to renounce their citizenship will be killed on sight. \nOfficially, Stygia’s main sources of income are the export of Precious Metals and Crafts, in that order. However, Stygia also runs an extensive slavery trade, and that is most likely also a major source of income. Stygia also exports powerful, finely crafted weapons and armor to select buyers, a benefit of Stygia’s unlikely but profitable trade relationship with the Dwarves of Gabilgathol.\nMost Stygian peasants make their living from stone working, trading, farming or fishing. According to the Stygian Caste system, citizens are born into their station in life, and may not change that station. This is not just “frowned upon”, it is actually enforced like any other crime. Peasants are typically only moderately literate in Verdurian (Stygia’s primary language), and illiterate otherwise. Almost all natives are fluent in Common speech, however.\nOnly one religion is allowed in Stygia, the worship of Set. If someone is caught with so much as a religious symbol pertaining to any other God, that person will be subject to whatever fate the Stygian Priest feels like dispensing. \nMagic is supported in Stygia through the Order of Set, the mage’s guild for Stygia, which is controlled by the Cult of Set. Red and Black colors are the only colors of magic allowed in Stygia. Offenders using any other color of magic are subject to punishment (typically, removal of eyes, ears, tongue, and hands). All magicians entering Stygia are required to register at the Mage’s guild. \nStygian diet consists of heavily spiced meat (poultry and fish are staples) in spiced sauces with vegetables considered exotic in many other lands. \nStygian architecture and art follow Middle-Eastern standards, while Stygian art is always religious middle-eastern. Stygian architecture is unique in that it is crafted of a quality unreachable by all other surface races.'
history = 'Stygia is the last of the “old kingdoms”. Stygia’s founder or founders are not common knowledge, but Stygian legends claim that they are descended from an ancient and powerful race that fled a great cataclysm in the west. Regardless, the first Stygian history is linked with the building of the monuments in or around year 400. The monuments are great, pyramid shaped structures bordering the southeastern edge of the Nomadic Sea. The purpose of these structures is lost to time, and no one known has been able to gain entrance to these structures in several millennia. Stygia once ruled the entire southern part of the continent to the Nomadic Sea (circa Year 500), with the ancient nation of Shem ruling the Nomadic Sea and the Femefinta Mountains. Somewhere between year 1000 and year 1200, however, Stygia lost control of the southeastern tip of the continent to the Wedei, but gained the western coastline up to where the Inland Causeway now exists (presumably by force). It is known, however, that Stygia’s war with Shem lasted for 1506 years, from year 185 until year 1691, making it the longest known war without a single break in recorded history. Unfortunately, no one knows for what the war was fought. \nA Stygian Irränë Befel named Tibur left Stygia near the end of the 150-year “War of the Crimson Sands”  (1356 – 1506) with Wedei to found Corrillia. Stygia immediately entered into war with Corrillia, a war that has only been broken by a single two-year cease-fire in over 2000 years. During this war, Stygia lost the western coast to Corrillia, and have been fighting ever since to regain it. \nIn 1695, the Wedei conquered the lands east of the Shustana Swamp, including the ancient Stygian capital of Shofmazhtana, forcing Stygia to settle into the section of the Morge Peninsula that they now inhabit. In 1698, however, the Stygian’s divined the key to the entrance to Gabilgathol, and by enchanting the exceptional quality arms and armor gained from trade with the Dwarves, Stygia was able to stave off Wedei’s advance. In 1701, Stygia founded their new capital, Shazidar, on the western coast of the realm below the Eliramitan River. This location had great strategic significance, as it was not only an excellent port to sea, protected from the worst of the weather by the Morge peninsula, it also had an excellent source of irrigation and water in the Eliramitan River, and was within 50 miles of Gabilgathol. Stygia poured the best of everything into Shazidar, creating 50’ high walls made of the hardest granite, towers that reached hundreds of feet into the sky, and buildings with architecture impressive to even Dwarves. Shazidar became the economic capital of Stygia, and eventually, the world, due mostly to the fact that Dwarven weapons and armor are only sold in Shazidar. Stygia began building other cites along the peninsula. The major cities included Rhisa Mazhtana (built on the site of an ancient Stygian fortress), Eucar Máz, Gran’akrhaner (commonly called Grakak), and Güscish. Güscish was the last of these cites, built to be the unconquerable religious center of Stygia, it includes granite walls 40’ high and 30’ thick, nine step-pyramids (one for each hell), and a chasm over 150 feet wide and of undetermined depth. All of this is located at the edge of the formidable Morge Jungle, one of the most dangerous places in the entire realm (paling to the Hinderlands, however). Güscish is where all Stygian priests are taught, and all priests return there as part of a grand religious festival on the night of beasts. All of these cities were founded in the years between 1710 and 1795, with the exception of Rhisa Mazhtana (which was officially rebuilt in 1487).  Stygia continued with sparse border fighting for the next 650 years or so, mostly fending off or attempting to gain territory on Wedei or Corrillia. When the Great Cataclysm hit in 2478, Stygia’s major cities were for the most part unaffected, due to the exceptional stonework of Stygian masons. The primary damage to Stygia was due to a few exceptionally tall towers which fell from the shockwave. Of course, smaller Stygian villages and cites were decimated, but unlike most nations, major structures in large cities remained standing.  Due to the loss of life involved with the Cataclysm, however, Stygia issued an unspoken cease-fire with all enemies for a period of two-years, whereby the dead were removed and temples rebuilt. Stygia was extremely interested in the new continent which they called (and still do) the “Dobrásh Chel Shorui sur Almea “, or “Greater Hell on Earth”. A special ship was crafted, and five of Stygia’s arch-bishops along with five Arch-Magi set out with a full crew to explore the continent in 2481. Of all nations to visit the Hinderlands, only Stygia seems to have been completely successful on all attempts. The Stygian contingent placed a custom made altar made of the finest Gold, Platinum, and Onyx on the island, and observed sacred rituals there, amid the lava, ashes, and beasts from the bowels of the most vile hell. No one is exactly sure why the Stygian’s place such importance on the island, but it is obviously of supreme importance to all of the Cult of Set, as once per year, an offering of Stygia’s finest materials is brought to the Island as an offering, and it is said, that once every 12 years, the virgin daughter of one of the Arch-Bishops is skinned alive and offered to whatever powers the Stygian’s believe to inhabit the island. \nRegardless, Stygia has advanced significantly in the years since, and now possesses what is most likely the best equipped, if not the best trained, military force in the realm. Stygia still battles at the border with Corrillia regularly, though neither side seems to be too eager to shed too much blood. The war with Wedei is still officially active, though a battle has not been openly fought between the two in hundreds of years, most likely due to the distance now separating the two kingdoms. In recent years, Stygia has seemed to calm down, becoming less eager to wage war or conquer territory. While most feel that this is rightfully so, some wander if Stygia is waiting on something.'

culture = 'The Eastern Empire’s culture is one with a single driving component: Perfection. The entire culture is organized, efficient, and precise, from their arts to their warfare. \nThe government itself is organized into a monarchy, ruled by the Emperor. The Empire is divided into four sections, each corresponding the geographical divisions of the Empire. Each section is ruled independently by a Selai (Warlord) who has final authority over all decisions within the region, whether they be civilian or military. The Emperor himself is considered to be divinely sent, and as such, is treated as a God. None of his decisions are ever questioned, and if he commands something, it will either be carried out or his vassals will die trying. \nSocially, the Empire is structured as a Caste system. Each citizen is born into his or her role in society, and may only change station in life under extreme circumstances. \nTaxation in the empire is low, hovering at around 10%. This low tax rate is sustainable due to the efficiency of the Empire’s economic system. Very little goes to waste, as each citizen devotes extraordinary effort into ensuring that their function in life is performed to the best of their ability. \nLife is very demanding for citizens of the Empire, with workdays of 16 hours or more not uncommon. However, they all have the mentality that they are a unit striving for the same goals, and everyone must give himself or herself unconditionally in the servitude of the emperor. In this way, the Eastern Empire is the most unique among all of the nations of the realm. \nMost citizens of the empire make their living through unskilled labor of one type or another. Farming, logging, and mining are the chief functions of most citizens. \nLaw in the Empire is enforced swiftly and severely. Each city or village has one Yuma Selu (Head protector) and one or more Selu (Protector) who act as judge, jury, and if necessary, executioner. Common punishments for various crimes are:\nTheft: \nFirst Offense: Flogging\nSecond Offense: Hobbling\nThird Offense: Death\nAdultery: Flogging\nFailure to follow an order or edict; Insubordination: Death\nMurder: Death\nLuckily, corruption is almost non-existent in the Empire. That is not to say that the legal system is fair, however. If an accused criminal can not convince the Selu otherwise, he or she is assumed to be guilty, and punished as such. As a result, crime is extremely rare in the Empire. \nWarfare in the Empire is also handled uniquely. A certain portion of the populace is in the Warrior Caste. This Caste is further divided by the role the warrior is to play. Those in this Caste (with the exception of peasants) are trained from birth in the art of war. In Eastern warfare, there are four general classifications of warriors, with sub classifications under each:\n•	Peasant\no	Yari Ashigaru: Peasant spear/pike men\no	Yari Cavalry: Peasant cavalry, armed with spears\n•	Conscripted\no	Cavalry Archers: Trained archers on horseback\no	Heavy Cavalry: Heavily armored cavalry, armed with swords\no	Naginata: Heavily armored foot soldiers, armed with extremely long “pike-swords”\n•	Samurai\no	Daisho Samurai: Standard Samurai\no	No-Dachi Samurai: Samurai with two-handed swords\no	Yari Samurai: Samurai spear/pike men\n•	Special\no	Sohei: Warrior Monks\no	Ninja: Assassins and Spies\no	Shinobi: Counterspies/Counter assassins\no	Geisha: Ultimate spy/assassin; female\nPeasant warriors include every able-bodied male within a certain age range. They have no special training, and are typically only called upon in times of war. Conscripted warriors are professional warriors, though they are not given the extensive training that Samurai or special troops receive. \nConscripted warriors typically spend the majority of their time performing menial tasks (guard duty, etc.)\nSamurai are the ultimate embodiment of the professional warrior in the Empire. They train from birth in a small range of weapons. Their honor code is strict, and spend nearly every waking hour either fighting, or preparing to fight.\nSpecialty warriors are also typically trained from birth, but their role is different. Specialty warriors are trained for the most dangerous of roles, and hone their skills to unthinkable levels in their pursuit of excellence. Since, in most cases, they have no “reinforcements” to rely upon in their missions, they are the most at risk of all warriors.\nThe Empire’s religious structure centers around the worship of the God Hachiman, though many other gods are recognized and worshipped as well. All religious activity is controlled by the monastery devoted to that particular God, and the monks within that monastery. \nThe magic structure in the Eastern Empire is very similar to the religious structure. A specific sect of monk contains Magi. Magic use is severely restricted in the Eastern Empire, and only around 1000 Magi exist in the Empire at any given time. However, magic use is just as advanced as any other major nation, due to the emphasis placed on efficient research by the Magi monastery. Magic use by outsiders is in no way permitted.\nMajor trade partners with the empire are Kebrina and to a lesser extent, Corrillia. The Empire’s primary exports are Lumber, Precious Metals, Precious Minerals, Rare Herbs, and Crafts, in that order. Weapons and armor are very rarely exported.\nThe Empire’s diet consists primarily of rice and other vegetables, with pork, chicken, and beef added to provide flavoring. Spices and sauces are extremely common in dishes.\nEastern architecture consists mostly of wooden structures, with paper being used as well in smaller dwellings. Though often scorned by other nations, this method of design has its advantages, most notably, ease of construction and repair, and minimal use of resources.\n'
history = 'The Eastern Empire began in Wedei. Wedei is an ancient nation built along the eastern coastline of the realm. The first known mention of Wedei was in 778 by the Stygian sage Ark’Thanok, who stated “Past the Ardënda desert (The ancient name for the Nomadic Sea) and the despicable peoples of Shem, lies two lands quite different from any others, the lands of Wedei and Mei. Both nations follow a similar lifestyle and have similar, nay, nearly identical peoples, but follow differing religious and political philosophies. While strange and generally free of humor, these peoples none-the-less contain riches in the form of beautiful and finely crafted Jade and Ivory trinkets. Their weaponry is also particularly cunningly crafted, and their fighting styles are second to none, except, of course, Stygian warriors.” \nIt seems that the small nations of Wedei and Mei had existed for several hundred if not thousands of years at this point, as other scholars tell of their advanced and highly organized political structures, advanced fighting arts, and strong magical roots. Ancient Wedei texts tell of ongoing wars between Wedei and Mei. The last of these wars seems to have begun in 1104, and only lasted for 6 years. In 1110, it seems the Mei, who by all accounts were on the losing end, agreed to a settlement whereby they would join with the Wedei peoples and form the “Empire of the Sea”, commonly known as the Eastern Empire. This was finalized, and in grand ceremony, Wedei Monarch Joh’Sun Chi was proclaimed emperor. \nIt took nearly 60 years for the two societies to become one, but by 1200, they had finally formed a cohesive whole. The Eastern Empire’s next target was the nation of Stygia, as they were already involved in a bitter war with Shem. However, the Eastern Empire peoples are not prone to rash moves, and they felt their army needed more preparation before beginning an attack. \nIn 1305, feeling the Empire was ready to embrace victory over Stygia, the Eastern Empire sent an advance party of Geisha and Ninja to disrupt the Stygian government from within. These specialized forces were initially unsuccessful at disrupting the government, however, they did manage to gain detailed information on Stygian military tactics and movements. Armed with this information, in 1356, the Eastern Empire launched an attack on the eastern-most Stygian city of Rhizhata. The Eastern Empire was victorious by a wide margin.  Due to their information regarding Stygian troop movements, they had chosen to attack exactly when they knew the Stygians would be least prepared. The Stygians, however, easily devined the source of the leak, however, and began hunting down and slaughtering spies within their empire. \nThe Eastern Empire had expected this, however, and had already acquired a large number of Stygian slaves. These were bred, and when the children were born, they were raised as Ninja and Geisha. These would prove a critical component of future events, but not in the manner they were intended.\nCounter-attacks from Stygia were waged, but Stygia had little success in retaking their lands. The tactics and training of the Eastern Empire’s troops were unlike any the Stygian military had ever experienced, and the Stygians continued to take losses.\nIn the years between 1422 and 1487, the Eastern Empire also sent their now mature Stygian Geisha into Stygia. Some of these were extremely successful. In particular, one serving as a concubine to the Irränë Befel Tibur discovered the extreme compassion the man felt for his family, particularly, his firstborn son. A plan was hatched, and another Geisha, serving as concubine to High Priest Tot’Amathet, planted the thought of a massive sacrifice of firstborn sons to summon the power of the Gods in aiding Stygia’s war effort. \nWhile this part of the plan worked perfectly, what happened next was completely unexpected. The Empire had hoped that the Irränë Befel, upon finding his firstborn son sacrificed, would attack and kill the High-Priest. Instead, having no thoughts towards Tibur’s feelings, Tot’Amathet proposed his plan to the Irränë Befel. Tibur, instead of breaking into a rage, simply walked out, gathered his finest soldiers, and marched into the wilderness to form a new country. \nWhile unexpected, this development was not necessarily unwelcomed, and was considered a great success for the Empire. Assisted by the lack of Stygian troops, as well as the fact that Stygia was now warring on three fronts, the Eastern Empire saw considerable success in the war. \nBy 1509, the Eastern Empire was making massive inroads into Stygian territory. The only thing slowing their advance was the lack of troops and peoples to adequately defend and support their new cities. With the confidence that the war was going as planned, the Emperor commanded that detachments of Geisha be sent into Shem, to disrupt their government in preparations of attacks following Stygia’s conquest. \nThe Geisha were successful beyond the Emporer’s wildest dreams. By assassinating key members of government and framing other members of government, they effectively split Shem into 5 factions, all fighting each other. By 1689, all that remained of the Shem military was a rag-tag group of militia men who could barely defend thire Stygian border. Shem was caught completely unawares when the Eastern Empire launched a full scale attack in November of 1690, and by new years day, 1691, Shem was no longer a power. \nIn 1695, the Eastern Empire finally succeeded in pushing Stygia back to the Morge peninsula, conquering all lands east of the Shustana Swamp. Feeling confident in their victory, the Emporer declared a halt to the advance in order to replenish and reinforce the troops. This proved disastrous for his plans of conquests, as this respite gave Stygia time to divulge the entrance to Gabilgathol and acquire dwarven weaponry.  Stygia’s newfound weaponry reenergized their troops, and these factors effectively equalized the conflict. For the next several hundred years, neither side would gain any significant territory. \nIn 2065, the Emporer received word that Solomanian forces were raiding northern cities and taking Imperial citizens captive. Angered by the news, the Emperor sent a large detachment of soldiers to defeat the relatively miniscule Solomanian army. Rather than crush the Solomanians, however, the Imperial army was slaughtered by the fearsome Solomanian Death Knights, and those that survived retreated back to Sudau. The Emperor, realizing his delicate position, chose to halt the conflict by sacrificing outlying villages and concentrating their populations into other Imperial cities. \nFor the next 400 years, the Imperial outlook changed from one of expansion, to one of survival. The Geisha were having little effect on the Stygians, as they had long ago become privy to them, and never had any effect on the Solomanians, due to their unique power structure. The Empire’s soldiers, while exceptional, were no match for the brute force of the Death Knights in close combat. And while the Empire’s soldiers were better trained than the Stygian armies, they were under-equipped and outmanned. It therefore became necessary for the Empire to concentrate on defense, never their strong suit. \nThe Eastern Empire began building walls of stone, rather than wood, to protect their cities. And edicts were sent out across the Empire for every family to produce as many children as possible to fuel the war efforts. \nUnfortunately, before the benefits of either of these actions could be fully realized, the cataclysm hit. The Eastern Empire was perhaps the hardest hit of any of the nations. Most of the ancient cities of Wedei and Mei, since they were built under the standard eastern architecture and constructed primarily of wood and paper, were completely destroyed. Being closest to the epicenter of the cataclysm, and containing mostly low-lying areas meant that the brunt of the tidal waves hit the Eastern Empire. The Capital of Mandau was completely demolished, along with several other prominent old-world cities. Luckily, the newly built walls spared a few cities, and most of the cities the Empire had conquered in the past had been built by Stygian masons. However, well over 90% of the Empire’s population, estimated to be over 6 million before the cataclysm, were killed or injured. Of the 300,000 or so that were left, a massive clean-up and rebuilding project awaited. It is a testament to the resilience of the people, however, that they were able to pick up the pieces and continue on. The Empire’s surviving generals ordered runners to visit every city site in the land, and order all citizens north of Mandau to travel to Sudau, while ordering all of the citizens west of Mandau to travel to Donai. In this way, when the Empire’s enemies sent scouting parties into the Empire, they found 100,000 armed “soldiers” (who were really mostly citizens in makeshift armor) waiting for them. Reporting this to their generals, the generals incorrectly surmised that the Eastern Empire was still a major force. On the downside, the Empire was force to give up a large tract of land west of Sivana to the Stygians, as the act of sending citizens across the Nomadic Sea would have surely been suicide. After border security was established, the Empire began rebuilding from the outside in. The massive numbers of dead required burial in mass graves, and for this reason, several large tracts of land in the Empire are marked as sacred. In the rebuilding process, the Empire chose to build most significant structures out of stone instead of the traditional materials. However, since masonry is new to the Empire, many of these structures have since required rebuilding. Today, the Empire is just finishing the recovery process. The population has swelled, and while still not reaching pre-cataclysm levels, the Eastern Empire is once again a force to be reckoned with.'

culture = 'The Nomads live an interesting, if difficult, life. The nomads wander the desert, primarily hunting for food and enslaving the occasional wanderer or caravan, which they trade for supplies in Sivana Kida. The Nomadic peoples are loosely organized in tribes of varying numbers, each tribe containing one Vanu (Chief), and around 20 families. The tribes rarely meet with one another, but when they do, celebration, not war, usually ensues. This is not to say that all tribes get along. In fact, there are always disputes among various tribes, however, unless actively engaged in tribal warfare, it is the ancient Shemite custom to greet fellow countrymen warmly. \nNomad tribes normally contain a detachment of livestock as well, primarily camels, used for various functions (camels are primarily used as pack animals and for their milk). \nNomadic families are typically extended, and will usually include four generations sharing a single Keda (house or tent). Polygamy is allowed only for the Vanu, who may have up to 5 wives. \nNomad males are trained from birth in the arts of horseback riding and archery. As a consequence, Nomads are the best horse archers in the realm, on average, capable of hitting a 2-inch target at full gallop from 50 yards or more. \nThe nomads maintain a city of sorts on the edge of the nomadic sea known as Sivana Kida. While technically property of the Eastern Empire, the city holds little value either strategically or economically, so the Empire let it fall into ruin. The nomads use the city as a trade center, bringing slaves and raided caravans in for sale back to Stygia. For this reason, Stygian caravans are never raided, and Stygian citizens are generally helped by the Nomads. Eastern Empire caravans and citizens, however, are raided viciously. The Eastern Empire tried for years to eliminate the Nomads, only to have their troops wander the desert aimlessly until death upon pursuit of the Nomads. For this reason, the Eastern Empire simply ships most it’s trade. \nNomads worship the god known as Orat-varyr-kas, or “The Everlasting Sky” (commonly known as “Brahman” to most Kebrini). Priests of this God are not required, and there are no Nomadic priests. \nMagic is unheard of in Nomad society.\nNomadic diet is typically sparse, consisting of what ever can be hunted in the desert (lizard and snake is common) supplemented with camel-milk sauces and camel-milk cheeses. \nNomads have no architecture to speak of. Nomads live in tents constructed of camel hide. Nomadic music and art is typical of middle-eastern cultures.'
history = 'The Nomads don’t really have a collective history.

culture = 'Kebrina is less of a country and more of a loose confederation of villages and cities with a common interest. Kebrina has no official founder or date of foundation, the Kebrinis are simply a race of peoples with a knack for persuasion and survival, and as such, they have tended to clump together over the centuries out of protection of their mutual interests. Officially, Kebrina is a small country led by Kulseu-Melah (Commander-King) Oberon. Each Kebrini village is controlled by a council of elders (Neisi Negi), who determine all facets of village life and law. Rather than being responsible for governing the entire country, the Kulseu-Melah in Ebdicai is simply responsible for providing for Kebrina’s defense. Each Kebrini village provides a portion of taxes to the Kulseu-Melah, with which the armies (Botheneu) are paid and forts supported. Consequently, Kebrina military forces are typically disorganized and minimally trained.\nWhile it varies by village or city, taxation in Kebrina is typically performed by the Neisi Negi, and only applies to the successful of the populace. Rather than being a set amount, the Neisi Negi negotiates with each wealthy citizen to determine the proper amount. It is a source of great pride to a Kebrini citizen to be responsible for the majority of the village’s taxes, and such a person is typically highly respected. \nLaw in Kebrina is typically enforced by the contingent of Kebrini Botheneu in a given village, and judgments are typically fairly resolved by the Neisi Negi. Punishments are typically light, with fines being the most common punishment for citizens and exile being the most common punishment for visitors. Each Kebrini citizen is responsible for reporting a perceived wrongdoing to a Negi within a village, and that Negi will typically judge the offense on the spot. While this is not a particularly efficient system, it works well for most of Kebrina’s tiny villages. For the great city of Ebdicai, the process is a bit different, due to the city’s great size and the great influx of visitors into the City. In Ebdicai, a contingent of Lic Botheneu (Soldier of Law) is maintained, as well as a makeshift jail. Offenders of other nationalities are incarcerated and await judgment by one of the city’s Saabeu. Minor offenses typically result in fines or jail time (jail time can typically be waived through payment of a large fine). Regardless, in all Kebrini populaces, violent punishment is extremely rare and only reserved for the worst of crimes. \nA Kebrini citizens stature in the populace is based on a very flexible Feudal system. While each citizen is born into a particular class or station in life, this can change depending on the citizen’s own successes or failures. Kebrini society is a very social society, however, and separation between classes is not nearly as severe as in most other nations.\nFormal education in Kebrini society is rare, and for this reason, few Kebrinis are literate. Most, however, speak both Common and Kebrini fluently. \nKebrini economy is based mostly on trade with other nations. Officially, Kebrina’s major exports are Lumber, Precious Metals, Precious Minerals, Rare Herbs, and Crafts, but unofficially, a brisk trade or Solomanian weapons and armor are one of Kebrina’s major sources of income. \nKebrina allows all religions, though the most popular among citizens is the Order of Brihaspati. Kebrina has no mages guilds.\nKebrini meals tend to be heavily spiced meats (usually freshwater fish, but it depends on the area) with generous sides of spiced rice and other vegetables.\nKebrini architecture tends toward simple Middle-Eastern structures. Kebrini art and music follows in the same vein.'
history = 'Kebrina, unlike most nations of the realm, has mostly kept to itself throughout history. The first reference in the ancient texts that refer to the Kebrini nation as such was by the ancient sage and explorer Bonefhutu in 964, where he stated “Kebrina is a nation of peace-loving and incredibly social peoples, welcoming all comers with open arms, and generally, much more open to merriment than their more ‘civilized’ neighbors”. At this time, Kebrini peoples occupied the sparse valleys and caves in the Femefinta Mountains, which has been typical of their various homes throughout the centuries. The Kebrini have typically made their home in areas that no other society wanted, thus reducing the possibility of war, as they had nothing a would-be conqueror could possibly want. \nDuring the various Solomanian/Corrillian wars, the Kebrini peoples migrated south into the uppermost regions of the Nomadic Sea, to eliminate the possibility of involvement in the battles. After the cataclysm (which seems not to have affected the Kebrinis at all), the Kebrini peoples migrated northward once again, this time into the now-deserted area below the Great Inland Sea. Founding several settlements, the Kebrini peoples made a useful home for themselves, and for the first time, raised a standing army to protect their newfound lands. In 2515, Corrillian King Olaf I sent out parties to assess if any of Corrillia’s remote cities above the Femefinta Mountains had survived the cataclysm. Upon discovering the Kebrini peoples inhabiting their lands, these parties met with the Kebrini peoples. Finding them sociable and easy-going, the parties returned to inform the King. King Olaf arranged a meeting with the elders of the Kebrini peoples in 2516, and a deal was struck up. The Corrillians would allow the Kebrinis to occupy those lands, if the Kebrinis, in return, would keep the Corrillians informed of the movement, actions, and internal organization of the Solomanians. Since the Kebrini merchants commonly visited Stonekeep, this arrangement worked well for both sides, and the deal was set.\nSince then, the Kebrini peoples have built a fledgeling governmental system, and the Kebrini city of Ebdicai has become known as one of the best trading centers in the land. While the Kebrinis have little hope of defending their lands if ever attacked, their penchant for survival and persuasion will surely see them through the calamity, should it occur.'

culture = 'Solomania is a nation that has been consumed with two passions since it’s founding: Magic and Warfare. Solomanian culture and government is based on martial law. Every role, every profession in Solomanian society can be classified into one of two broad groups: Military occupations, and slaves. All free citizens, including magi and priests within Solomania, are military professions. Everything you may purchase from mercantile establishments within Solomania are owned by the government and military, from the Ale at the local Inn to Arms and Armor at the Mercantile Guild. \nLaw in Solomania consists of two types: Internal law (for citizens), and external law (for visiting merchants and such). Internal law consists of a court marshal, where citizens are judged by high ranking military officers and sentenced according to their crimes. Punishment for internal crimes is typically one of three things: slavery for a period of time, exile, or death. For external law, you are typically tried on the spot by the arresting officer (Officer of the State). If he believes your story, you may be set free. However, if he finds you guilty of a crime, you will typically be killed on the spot. With a few exceptions, crimes against the state by outsiders are punishable by death. However, crimes against other outsiders are ignored by the Solomanian government. As far as they are concerned, if you commit a crime that has no direct effect on the state, it isn’t their problem. So while stealing from a Solomanian citizen would get you the punishment of death, stealing from an out-of-town merchant will be ignored. For this reason, Solomania can be a very dangerous place for outsiders. Luckily, outsiders are only permitted entrance to Stonedark if they have a reason that can somehow help the state, making this problem less likely to occur. \nAlso, unlike some other forms of government, punishment for corrupt Solomanian officers is very severe, making corruption extremely rare.\nThe Solomanian power structure flows from the King through military ranks, like so:\nKing\nGeneral of Arms/Navy/Knights/Magi\nHead Priest\nDivision Captain\nSquad Captain\nDeath Knight\nMage\nPriest\nShip Captain\nArcher\nFirst Mate\nSwordsman\nPikeman\nCrewman\nSupport\nSolomanian Military organization functions as follows:\n•	Each Branch (with the exception of supporting branches) is divided into one or more divisions. The Arms branch contains 20 divisions, the Navy branch contains 5 divisions, the Knights branch contains 10 divisions, and the magi branch contains 2 divisions\n•	Each division is divided into 10 squads.\n•	Each squad contains a certain distribution of men, as follows:\no	Arms: 50 Pikemen, 20 Swordsmen, 10 Archers, 2 Priests, 1 Mage\no	Navy: 2 Battleships with 30 crewmen, 1 First Mate, 1 Captain, 1 Priest, and 1 Mage\no	Knights: 50 Death Knights, 1 Priest, 1 Mage\no	1 Priest, 5 Magi\nSupport functions include manning Inns, the Mercantile Guild, Mine Foremen, etc. \nRoles for males are chosen at the age of ten, when the males are put through an extensive series of tests. Males are trained from birth in combat, magic, and religion. Females are always partners for males. A female becomes eligible at the age of 15, whereby any male may choose her. Polygamy is allowed, and males have “quotas” for partners based on their rank. In the case where multiple males choose the same partner, the one with the highest rank wins. If there is a tie at rank, the one with the least number of partners wins. \nSolomania has no taxation. Since nearly all things are owned by the government, the government makes money off of all trade. \nSolomania’s main source of income is from the trade of weapons, armor, minor magical items, and raw precious minerals. Though none claim to be trade partners with Solomania, Kebrina merchants import much of Solomania’s stock and resale that to other citizens.\nThere are no peasants, as such, in Solomania. All citizens make a living based on their rank in the Military. Slaves, of course, receive no income.\nUnlike most other nations, all Solomanians are fully literate and highly educated.\nSolomania’s sole religion is the worship of Arawn, the Celtic God of Death.\nSolomanian magic is controlled by the Magi branch of the Solomanian military. No non-military magic use is allowed, but there are no restrictions on color (black is preferred, however) for military magi.\nSolomanian diet consists of standard, balanced meals with no variation in diet allowed.\nSolomanina architecture tends to be Gothic European. Art and Music are not allowed.'
h1 = 'Founded in 1212 by Solomon “The Wise”, Solomania was initially a single temple structure and outlying City-State devoted to the magic arts. Solomon himself was a powerful white mage who had devoted his life to the pursuit of Magic. Throughout his young adult life, Solomon sought knowledge in all forms, traveling to distant lands and unfathomable crypts in his tireless search of eldritch wizardry.  Through his travels, Solomon amassed power and a reputation second to none, and Kings throughout the realm were begging for Solomon’s advice and help on various issues. Solomon eventually formed a loose alliance with the Antarans, and in return, was awarded a large plot of land on the eastern shore to build his dream of a magical outpost. In 1210, work began on Solomon’s temple, and by 1212, the work had been completed. Solomon had scores of lesser mages wishing to do his bidding, and soon built a thriving economic power as well, by providing various magical goods and services. He kept a team of closely guarded Arch-Magi working with him around the clock on spell research, and is said to have amassed more than 500 new spells, some of which harnessed power never before seen. By 1225, however, Solomon began to reach the pinnacle of what is magically possible. Legend states the Solomon proclaimed “Other realms besides this one exist, realms which we can neither see, nor hear, nor touch, and yet, these realms surround us on all sides, and consume us in their magnificence. If we could only open our eyes, perhaps we could finally see the light.” In the summer of 1227, Solomon, now approaching 40, proclaimed to his most trusted inner circle that he would be “taking a leave for a distant land”, and that “Work at the Temple should continue” if he never were to return. Though no one claims to have seen Solomon leave, the next morning, Solomon was gone. Save a few powerful relics, he had left all of his worldly possessions in his room. Solomon was not heard from for another 3 years, until one night in 1230, a thud and exhausted moan was heard emanating from Solomon’s room by a guard. There, Solomon lay, looking like a man of half his years, yet with hair that, strangely, had become completely white. Solomon was cared for extensively, and for 41 days, never awoke, never ate, and never drank. Yet, somehow, none of these things seemed to take a toll on his physical countenance. At midnight of the 42nd day, Solomon bolted upright out of his bed, and without even recognizing his loyal followers and close friends, strode purposely into his workshop.  For years, Solomon worked ceaselessly, ignoring all requests for council, sleep, and sustenance, somehow, surviving. His followers grew weary, and dispossessed by their liege, left little by little. Still, Solomon worked. By 1248, Solomania was a deserted ruin. The grounds had been looted, and after years of neglect, many of the city’s structures began to surrender to nature. All save Solomon’s tower. Solomon was not heard from again for some time, and by 1275, was presumed to be dead, and his triumphs were relegated to myth and fable. All that was to change, however, on the night of beasts in 1280. Legend has is, Solomon arrived at Antara’s port city of Tremous on the back of black stallion, whose eyes glowed like fire and smelled of brimstone. Solomon, at the time approaching 100, was claimed to have white eyes with no pupils, skin that barely covered his bones, and the look of a man who should have long since been dead. Yet, there was still the old power in his voice when he commanded the City of Tremous to surrender, and worship him for the God he was. Legend claims of 5000 of Tremous’ 7000 inhabitants immediately fell to their knees in tears, worshipping Solomon. The rest of the citizens, however, began an immediate advance upon the old man. Solomon never moved, and uttered not a single word, as the 7000 brothers, sisters, husbands and wives, children, and friends slaughtered one another on the street. The slaughter of Tremous, it was called, and stands to this day as one of the most heinous acts in the history of the realm. But Solomon was not finished. Far from it. Sages talk of how he reanimated all 7000 dead citizens, and marched back to his spire. The city of Solomon, the center of magical power in the old world, would once again claim the title. But this time, it would be built on the backs of the dead. The rest of the world was stunned and repulsed to learn of this great betrayal, none more so than the Antaran King, Richard IV, who held fond memories of the “old Solomon” from his days as a lad. Mages across the land warned of Solomon’s power. They felt the influence of the Mage from all locations, a terrible and awesome power that could bend wills and destroy minds. Antara sent an army of over 20,000 foot soldiers, including their most elite ranger force, to destroy Solomon and his temple once and for all. The force left on December 12, 1280, and returned on January 10, 1281 as an army of zombies, sacking three of Antara’s cities before being destroyed at the capital. King Richard IV was hopeless, as no mage in all the realm would stand against Solomon, and warriors could not resist his power. All save one. In February of 1281, King Richard called upon his last hope for the safety of his kingdom in the unlikely guise of a Barbarian chieftain known as Fafnir the Disenchanted. King Richard promised the City of Grelan (now Broderni-Borg), and all of the surrounding territory, to the barbarians in exchange for the head of Solomon. The barbarians, fearing nothing, accepted, and a horde of 5000 barbarians advanced on Solomania at a frightening pace. The battle that took place is said to have lasted for 20 nights, during which time, over 25,000 undead beasts of all varieties were put to their final death. Solomon, however, had yet to be seen. Fafnir, and a small group of the remaining barbarians, cautiously began exploring Solomon’s spire. Upon reaching the uppermost level, they witnessed a sight so unholy and unnatural as to render the remaining barbarians, save Fafnir himself, completely and irreversibly insane. At some point during the battle, Solomon had finished a dark, ancient ritual thought to be lost to time, prolonging his existence in exchange for his soul. Solomon had become the closest to a God that a mortal man can, by becoming a Lich. As Fafnir watched, the mere sight of Solomon’s lich-form destroyed the minds Fafnir’s companions, some of the bravest and strongest warriors on the face of the realms. For the first time in his life, Fafnir knew fear. It is said that Fafnir ran screaming from the room, followed by the insane cackle of the Lich-King Solomon. At the bottom of the stairs however, Fafnir stopped, overcome with shame. He had betrayed his people, betrayed his friends, and betrayed his God, by showing cowardice in the face of Evil. Fafnir, bowed by remorse, regret, and shame, knew what had to be done. He could never show his face in the northern lands again, for he did not deserve to be Chieftain. Fafnir, perhaps the greatest leader and hero of the Barbarian peoples, had been broken. He was never heard from again.\nSolomon the “Lich-King” was not heard from for another 200 years. Time began taking its inevitable toll on the memory of people, and “Solomon the Lich-King” became a fairy tale used to frighten wayward children. Solomon was not defeated however, and during these years, it is said he came in vivid visions to all with an affinity to black magic. Many found his promises and his power irresistible, and left their normal lives to join Solomon’s growing cult. In 1490, outcasts and criminals from various civilizations began disappearing. Crime rates realm-wide began dropping. People thought the golden age had begun, while in truth, the dark age was just beginning. In 1498, an army of undead attacked the border town of Ariel in Antara, slaying all residents and burning the city to the ground. The Solomanian city of Stonedark was founded on the still glowing embers of Ariel. Solomania was reborn, and the Lich-King Solomon made his presence known. Over the next 150 years, Solomon’s armies of undead, black magi, and human warriors waged unceasing war on Antara. Solomania lost not a single battle, and the conquest of Antara was complete in 1649. The Antaran survivors were then used by the Lich-King as slave labor, to mine ore, build weapons and armor, and farm the lands. Solomania then directed the war effort against the new kingdom of Corrillia. For 60 years, Corrillia and Solomania fought ceaselessly. For the first few years, it appeared as if Corrillia would be the next victim of the army of the dead. However, in 1666, the brilliant Corrillian Arch-Druid Cantose devised a potion that, if drank before a battle, would render the soldier’s body unanimatable were he to be killed in that battle.  The potion was a huge success, and deprived of their never-ending supply of dead, the armies of dead could no longer be replenished. Corrillia began to halt the advance, and eventually retook most of their territorial loss. Upon the beginning of the Eastern Empire’s expansion, the King Tristrom of Corrillia saw the potential to impact the growing Solomanian power structure by enticing the budding Eastern Empire into war with Solomania. The secret to the potion of final rest was “leaked” to the Eastern Empire for this reason. Armed with this powerful weapon against reanimation, the Eastern Empire began expanding north, conquering several Solomanian cities. Solomon was furious, but even in insanity was wise enough to realize his position. Peace was declared between Solomania and Corrillia in 1712. \nSolomania reinforced the positions along it’s southern border against the Eastern Empire, and, aided by the losses the Empire began facing against the better equipped Stygians, Solomania was able to maintain their holdings despite the shortage of undead troops.'
h2 = '\nSolomon had not wavered, however, in his desire for conquest, and began looking at alternate troops. To this end, he assigned his highest-ranking mage, Mordinkain, the task of capturing and breeding magical creatures to replenish his army with. He also began training the first legions of the feared “Solomanian Death Knights” from the hardiest of his warriors. In 2010, Solomania entered into a joint attack with Corrillia on the barbarians. The Corrillians, however, withdrew in the heat of the conflict, angering the Lich-King to unthinkable levels. The Lich-King professed that, after Hyperborea, the next nation to fall to Solomanian troops WOULD be Corrillia. \nIn one of the final battles of the war, Mordinkain was slain on the battlefield by a barbarian horde. When this occurred, all of Mordinkain’s summoned and controlled creatures were allowed to run free. Hundreds of these rare and powerful beasts fled into the wilderness, but a few remained and turned on any human within striking distance, including the Solomanians. In a stroke of luck, another barbarian tribe had chosen to independently attack Solomania’s capital and Solomon himself. While, normally, this would have been suicide, do to the depletion of his forces by Mordinkain’s death, the Lich-King was not very well defended. This time, rather than attempt to face the Lich-King directly, however, the barbarians simply gathered outside of the Lich-King’s spire, and using downed trees, ropes, and the strength of 2000 angry barbarians, pulled the spire over, burying the Lich-King in tons of rock.\nThe site where the original city of Solomania stood was home to a sudden depression in the earth. Water entered from the sea, murk and mire from the thousands of dead mingled with the ancient magic of the temple grounds, and over the course of the next year, a new swamp formed in the realm. This swamp, known as the bog of decay, is one of the most avoided areas of the realm to this day. \nWith Solomon dead, the captain of the Solomanian guard became heir to the throne. King Orin, as the new head of Solomania, spent the next 15 years preparing for war against the nation that had betrayed Solomon in the Hyperborian conquest, Corrillia. Without the Lich-King’s wealth, however, King Orin was leader of an economically destitute nation. Immigration was minimal, of course, and trade non-existent. King Orin resolved these problems in the short term by charging high fees to all merchants and caravans passing through Solomania’s now extensive lands.  Orin sent raiding parties of Death Knights into the neighboring Eastern Empire to capture more slaves. Additional camps were created, and goods were created solely for the purpose of export. Unscrupulous merchants began visiting Solomania, lured by the ability to buy goods at unheard of prices, and money flowed into the nation. King Orin worshipped Arawn, the Celtic God of death, and had temples built to honor the God all across the nation. Priests of Arawn, simply tolerated in other societies, were actively welcomed in Solomania, and like the black magi, began flocking to Solomania. Thus, on the back of the outcasts and slaves, Solomania was rebuilt. With Solomania’s small economic successes, the King began actively recruiting warriors from the ranks of mercenaries and disenchanted citizens of other nations.  \nIn 2036, Solomania declared war on Corrillia. King Orin was confident in Solomania’s chances, but had sorely underestimated the resolve of the Corrillian people. In the next 20 years, the war between Corrillia and Solomania would result in minimal gains for either side. In 2052, however, King Whisndown of Corrillia found Solomania’s weakness. Using surprise attack tactics, Corrillia’s forces attacked the relatively undefended slave camps along the Solomanian borders. Freeing the slaves, they equipped them as soldiers in return for their Corrillian citizenship. Most were only too happy to comply, and in the next few years, Corrillia would make massive inroads in the war effort, conquering most of Solomania’s territory and financially crippling the nation. In 2058, old King Orin was assassinated by his own Death Knights, and King Bachar’ahner, the Knight Lord, took the Solomanian throne. Solomania was transformed quickly. King Bachar’ahner “The Ruthless” understood that, in order for Solomania to survive, Solomanian soldiers needed to be the equal of 10 or more Corrillian soldiers. He set his contingent of priests and magi to creating potions and amulets to increase the power of his men. King Bachar’ahner pulled forces out of all remaining Solomanian cities, save well-fortified capital of Stonedark. Slaves were slaughtered upon leaving the cities, and animated by the black magicians. The armies of undead were then sent out to roam the countryside, wreaking havoc on the advancing Corrillian armies. The Corrillians, deprived of their advantage and set upon by legions of undead, retreated back to their keeps at the border. By the time the undead had been destroyed and Corrillia was able to continue their advance, their army had been reduced from over 150,000 soldiers to less than 70,000. When the Corrillians finally reached Stonedark in 2065, they numbered less than 45,000 men. Stonedark’s forces, however, numbered less than 5000 men. Rather than allow a prolonged siege, which would surely destroy the Solomanian force, King Bachar’ahner chose to use a unique strategy. A trap was set, utilizing approximately half of Stonedark’s 20,000 slaves as both bait and weapon. Massive quantities of gunpowder were spread across the fields leading to Stonedark. Catapults were armed with rocks that had been hollowed enough to break on impact, and then filled with oil and gunpowder. The fort’s Ballistas were armed with bolts tipped with rags soaked in oil. Finally, Stonedark’s massive moat was filled with oil. Upon the arrival of the Corrillian army, King Bachar’ahner waited until the Corrillians had advanced into the “field of death”. He then ordered the white flag to be flown, opened the gates, and allowed the slaves to run free. However, King Bachar’ahner left the drawbridge over the moat up, forcing the slaves to swim to freedom. The slaves crossed the moat, coating themselves in oil, and ran to the Corrillian army, overjoyed to be free. Many members of the Corrillian army were also former slaves, and upon recognizing what was happening, ran forward to embrace their countrymen. When around half of the slaves had reached the opposing army, cheers of victory could be heard from the Corrillians, as they accepted the obvious surrender. It was then that King Bachar’ahner ordered the portcullis dropped and the volleys loosed. Hundreds of ignited ballista bolts rained down on the freed slaves, igniting their oil-soaked clothing. This ignited the gunpowder on the ground causing havoc among the Corrillian army. While the opposing army panicked and attempted to extinguish the flames, the catapults were loosed, sending hundreds of stones into the fray that exploded on impact and spread their deadly cargo. More men caught fire and burned as the Corrillian army attempted to organize a retreat. With over 30,000 of Corrillia’s forces on fire or dead, King Bachar’ahner ordered the portcullis raised, the drawbridge dropped and the knights to charge. 4000 Death Knights took to the field, their horses, clothing, and bodies caked with mud and water to protect from the flames. The retreating Corrillian army was decimated, and by the end of the battle, over 30,000 bodies littered the field. Those that had not taken the potion against reanimation were animated as zombies, and sent in an advance attack on the outlying Corrillian cities.'
h3 = '\nKing Bachar’ahner sent 1000 of his Death Knights across the border to regain control of these cities. For the most part, he found them deserted, save for the aftermath of the zombie attacks. Slaves were sent from Stonedark to repopulate three of the towns, with the reanimated dead and a small contingent of Death Knights used to protect and control each town. A group of Death Knights was then sent to capture citizens from the nearby Eastern Empire villages in order to replenish the stock of slaves in Stonedark. \nThis angered the Eastern Empire, and feeling the time was right, ordered an army of 50,000 soldiers to attack Stonedark. King Bachar’ahner sent his entire force of Death Knights from Stonedark to meet the Eastern Army. In the battle that followed, the Death Knights decimated the Eastern army, taking less than 100 casualties while killing over 75%% of the Eastern force, all at odds greater than 10:1. These defeats left both the Eastern Empire and Corrillia in delicate positions.  Both had lost massive amounts of forces attempting to eliminate Solomania, and both still had large quantities of land to defend. The Eastern Empire decided to beef up security at the Solomanian border, abandoning several villages and bringing those citizens into nearby walled cities in preparation of further raids. Corrillia, however, had other plans, and continued to launch attacks against the Solomanians. After 30 years of fighting, Corrillian forces finally succeeded in driving the Solomanians back into Stonedark in 2102. However, the Corrillians could not seem to defeat the Solomanians at their capital. After nearly 100 years of continued attacks with forces of varying sizes, the Corrillians finally stopped their “advance” in 2200. For the next 200 years, Solomania expanded from within, breeding slaves and training the offspring of their soldiers as warriors practically from birth. Stonekeep remained a haven for Priests of Arawn and black magi, and the city walls expanded outward in circles to accommodate the city’s growth. Unscrupulous merchants still visit the city regularly, buying wares at the state-owned mercantile guild at prices unheard of in other lands. \nWhen the cataclysm hit in 2478, Stonedark was hit hard. Tidal waves from the sea washed out most of the city’s docks. Shockwaves crumpled the old inner walls, and toppled the smaller of the outer walls. Buildings fell into rubble, and over half of Stonedark’s population was killed. Luckily for Solomania, Stonedark was a town made almost entirely of massive, strong stone structures, and relatively speaking, took considerably less damage than most of it’s neighboring cities, some of which were destroyed entirely. Stonedark’s contingent of magi animated those killed in the cataclysm, and used the undead to help move stones and rebuild the city. As a result, Stonedark was nearly completely rebuilt in less than a year, leaving Solomania in an excellent position, defensively. Unfortunately, offensively, Solomania was no better off than other nations, as their already small army was decimated by the catastrophe. Stonedark recovered, however, and Solomania once again began to attack and conquer Corrillian territory. Rather than attempting to take large plots of land, however, the strategy Solomania has relied on for the last 1000 years is to take small plots of land at a time by simply building an additional wall around Stonedark and expanding into it. For this reason, in terms of pure area, Stonedark is perhaps the largest city the world has ever known, encompassing nearly the entire “nation” of Solomania. Attacks on Stonedark from the Eastern Empire and Corrillia are extremely rare in modern times, as the defenses present in Stonedark make it nearly impossible to conquer, the Solomanian Death Knights are some of the most fearsome forces in all of the realm, and the massive land encompassed by Stonedark make siege efforts futile. While no one knows exactly why the Solomanians have chosen not to launch another offensive against their enemies, on thing is for certain: There is a reason, and only time will tell what that reason is.\n'
